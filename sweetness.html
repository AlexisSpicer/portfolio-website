            <p>Sweetness was designed as a responsive app and e-commerce store that allows customers to easily navigate and filter through the extensive Sweetness inventory and reduce the amount of time it takes for a customer to select their desired
              sweet. With a vast array of sweets offered, many customers became overwhelmed and quickly finalized their order, resulting in a reduced quantity of items purchased in a single transaction. This meant developing smart filtering options
              that were easy to navigate whilst maintaining the aesthetic design of the brand.</p>
            <p>I was the acting UI/UX Designer and I created a user flow diagram, wireframes, branding, mockups and preformed user testing. This piece took one month to complete, June of 2021 and Sketch was utilized.</p>

                <h3>User Flow</h3>
                <p>Three user stories were used to create a User Flow Diagram; a new customer wants advanced filtering options, place multiple items in a shopping cart, so that they can purchase more than one item at a time, and they want to access
                  the inventory without having to register. A user flow diagram was created to detail the number of screens needed to accomodate these tasks.</p>

                <p>Based on the user flow, screens were promptly sketched and then digitized to Mid-fidelity Wireframes, a prototype was created and sent out to test the user flow. High-Fidelity wireframes exhibited the addition of user testing
                  input.</p>

                <h3>Branding</h3>
                <p>Sweetness was in need of a rebrand. The look of the app and website sought to create a nostalgic feel. Soft pastel pinks and greens were selected to accommodate the old fashioned candy look. A text logo was created and the image of
                  the candy icon was inspired by the easy to recognise iconic lollipop.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> A responsive app was successfully created allowing for the user to easily and quickly filter their favorite sweets. After user testing, the application was further honed to simplify the process of ordering multiple products. Sweetness
              accomplished it’s goals to allow the ability to filter through the mass amount of candy inventory, order multiple items, all while not having to create an account. Sweetness also adhered to the brand guidelines and the app and website
              are cohesive as a result.</p>
