            <p> This piece was created to offer a vintage clothing app that makes the act of selling and buying preloved items easy, by reducing the amount of steps needed to complete a transaction and sell an item, as well as offer a sense of
              security with user reviews.</p>
            <p>I was the UI Designer, and completed a competitive analysis, created wireframes, a mood board, and style guide and preformed a redesign showcasing what I had learned throughout my CareerFoundry course. I used Sketch and the app was
              completed within four weeks in the month of January 2021 and redesigned in one week in June of 2021.</p>

                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>Viewing the competitor proved to be an educational and valuable to the development of the DRES app. Three competitor apps were reviewed and their solutions and items included for a messaging system, user login, and shopping cart
                  where inspirational to the screens designed for DRES. Heroine had a well designed message system and not only was it simple to use it contained a lot of information about the product and a preview of each message. Vestiaire’s sign
                  in is simple requiring an email and password or the option to to sign in with one of the user’s preestablished accounts, via Facebook, Google, or Apple. Etsy’s Shopping cart allows user to see what product is in their cart, the
                  price of the item and gives the user the ability to remove or save the item for later.</p>

                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>The Sketches incorporated the design patterns from the competitor analysis and the user goals. The user goals include a simplification of the buying and selling transaction, a shopping cart that could hold multiple items, and a
                  place for user’s to leave reviews. Sketches were connected by arrows to annotate the user flow of the screens.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>Icons</h3>
                <p>An icon set was created from scratch to capture a bold art deco feel and sleek geometry paired with gold embellishments were the backbone of the icon design. A bright gold provided more contrast between the navy and the the white
                  space on the screens.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>Color Palette</h3>
                <p>In the first iteration of the color palette the colors were muted, sutble, and strongly resembled the colors from the original mood board, however there was not enough contrast and the green didn’t add much to the design. The final
                  iteration of the colors, provided a bolder pallete that displayed more contrast, specifically between the icon outlines and the gold. Gold became more prominant, holding true to the art deco theme and really complimented the navy
                  color adding to the bold rich feel of the app.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>Wireframe and Redesign</h3>
                <p>The first set of final wireframes adhered to the original mood board, again subtle and muted colors, thus wireframes lacked contrast and unity in color palette and imagery.</p>
                <p>More screens were added to improve the functionality of the app and allow the user to reach their goals and improve the user flow. Colors were adjusted to offer more contrast and support the images presented. Images were improved
                  to showcase the item that was for sale and bring an overall aesthetically pleasing look to the app.</p>

            <h2 id="center">Conclusion</h2>
            <p> It was such a pleasure to take a second look at this project and for me that meant, I acquired a wealth of knowledge. I could easily see what changes were needed to improve the functionality and appearance of the application. It was a
              testament of my progress, and it gave me the chance to pour all my new knowledge back into this redesign. I believe this vintage clothing app simplified the act of selling and buying preloved clothing and offers security to it’s users
              with a messaging and user review system.</p>
