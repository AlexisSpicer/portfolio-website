            <p>I was asked to deliver an iOS and Android set of native apps to offer users the ability to snap a photo, identify an unknown plant, save their results to a gallery, and offer a personal plant care calendar in a quick and easy manner.  Identification of plants occur quickly and easily with PlantPose, it’s as simple as taking a photo.  The mobile version of this app offers the user, the freedom to explore and learn anytime they have their phone on hand.</p>
            <p>I was the UI/UX Designer for this project and I preformed competitor research, created a user flow, sketched, branded the app, and conducted user tests in order to finalize my screen mockups, haptics, sounds, and prototype. I used Sketch and the app was completed within four weeks in the month of May 2021.</p>

                <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
                <p>The goal for the user was to offer a simple solution in the form of an iOS and Android app that provides information on thousands of plants in a simple and friendly format, by taking a photo, saving the results, and saving timely reminders to care for the user’s plants.   Three competitor apps were selected for review and every button was pressed and their solutions were scrutinized.  Four additional screens were added to the PlantPose wireframes as a result of the competitor analysis; a permission to use the camera screen, a loading screen and error screen providing information for the user, and an improvement to the camera screen, in which the camera button darkens once a user presses button.</p>

                <h3>User Flow</h3>
                <p>Three goals for the user were established; the user wants to identity an unknown plant by taking a photograph and receive an instant summary of the basic information of the plant, store their discovery in their gallery, and receive timely reminders of how and when to care for numerous plant species.</p>

                <h3>Haptic Feedback, Sound, and Gestures</h3>
                <p>The addition of haptic feedback, gestures, and sound enhance the user experience, going beyond the visual and engaging the user with sound and tactile sensation and allows for the user to further immerse themselves into the experience.  The cue of the shutter sound when the camera button is pressed signals to the user that an action has taken place.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>The name PlantPose came because before a “Plant” could be identified it must “Pose” before a camera. The visual styling centered around the creation of main icon a camera flower, inspired by a blush colored rose.  Blushed pink was applied to the camera and dark green was added to resemble healthy leafy foliage.  Standard fonts were then applied, San Francisco for the iOS app and Roboto for the Android App.  The finalized high-fidelity screens were a culmination of user feedback, branding, and the standard guidelines of iOS and Android apps.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Researching, understanding, and applying the latest human interface guidelines from Apple and Materials Designs was paramount to laying the foundation for the creation of two versions of the native app, Plant Pose. The use of the guidelines ensures that the user is already familiar with the app upon entry and then the branding could be added to create the feel of the PlantPose.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> I accomplished creating an app that offers users a simple and aesthetically pleasing solution to identify an unknown plant on both an iOS and Android platform.  I thoroughly enjoyed researching, understanding, and applying the latest human interface guidelines from Apple and Materials Designs.   I believe PlantPose offers a simple solution to plant identification, plant care, and storing user photos.</p>
