            <p> This piece is a responsive web app that offers customers a solution to problems they may face with existing location based recommendation apps, such as lack real time restaurant deals. Local Craves was created to offer a display of
              real time local restaurant deals for the user to discover based on user proximity and their cuisine preference. Users can simply save and claim those deals. Once a user has claimed a deal they can publish a review for other users within the
              local community to see.</p>
            <p>I was the UI/UX Designer for this project and I created a user flow, sketches, preformed competitor analysis, and conducted user tests to develop user personas. With user personas, a mood board, and style guide I created the final
              high-fidelity wireframes and mockups using Sketch and Invison. The app was completed within four weeks in April 2021.</p>

                <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
                <p>A SWOT analysis was conducted on what would be the two main competitors of Local Craves; Foursquare and Road Trippers. I gained perspective on some promising ideas on my own product could outperform those apps, by providing easier
                  ways to filter cuisine preferences and providing up to date deals to users.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>User research was then performed to create a design that would incorporate the motivational behavior of the user and how the user would accomplish the goals of finding a local deal based on cuisine preference, as well as obtaining
                  and reviewing the deal. Their motivation was to locate local restaurant gems and have the ability to act on real time deals. They would do so by creating a user profile, changing their cuisine preferences as well as share their
                  location to discover deals. This set the stage for the user flow and the screens of the application.</p>

                <h3>Branding</h3>
                <p>Food images were paramount to invite the user to check out a deal and a softer color palette was chosen to evoke a sense of openness and airiness. A clean look, with contrasting colors was key to bring out the pictures of the food.
                  Travel was considered, where tourists or locals could discover local restaurant gems and encourage a sense of community.</p>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>After establishing the brand and the motivations and goals of the user, a user flow diagram was created as the initial blueprint for the screens of the wireframes. Sketches explored a hortizontal display of the restaurant
                  offerings, and a quick user preference test revealed that the user preferred a vertical display. The mid-fidelity wireframes reflect that change and ultimately the display remained the same for the high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

                <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                <p>The designs of the mid-fidelity wireframes were sent out for preference testing and user feedback. The feedback from users and the combination of the styleguide resulted in the final high fildelity wireframes which included a
                  softer lines and a increase in white space.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>After the completion of the high-fildeilty wireframes, two screens were choosen to scale for responsive design. The home screen and feed screen underwent a transformation on phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop screens. Again
                  preference testing was preformed to hone these screens and the user input was valuable to the creation of the final product.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Many located based applications, offer the convenience of finding restaurants that are close to user. However there remained a gap that needs to be filled because some restaurants that appear on these apps are no longer in business and
              ones that are open only take coupons for select chains. Local Craves is a responsive web app that fills that gap, it was created to offer a display of real time local restaurant deals for the user to discover based on user proximity and
              their cuisine preference.</p>
